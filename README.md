FluxEngine test data
====================

This is a set of test images for the FluxEngine project
(http://cowlark.com/fluxengine). They come in pairs, each named after the
appropriate profile: one `.flux` file and one image file of the default kind
for that profile. This is used by automated tests to check for regressions in
the decoder.

The files themselves are of blank freshly-formatted disks, so there (should be)
no copyrightable data in them. If you find there is, please file a bug so I can
remove it ASAP.
